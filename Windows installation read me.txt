To install, just run the "Multi-region Exporter - for Cubase-2.0.msi" installer.

Note that when running the msi installer, Windows will probably say:

"Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."

To install anyway, just click "More info" and then "Run anyway"

You can uninstall again just like uninstalling any other application.
