The Multi-region Exporter - for Cubase consists partly of other software (SoX, FFmpeg, OpenJDK) distributed along with it.
Each of these have their own license agreement.

The audio splitting is done by SoX - Sound eXchange (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) which is distributed in binary form with The Multi-region Exporter - for Cubase. SoX itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2. The source code for SoX can be found on the SoX project's homepage. Below I have included the license notification from the SoX documentation:

A big thanks to SoX for creating and sharing their tool.

The generation of audio waveform and the optional conversion to other formats is done by FFmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) which is distributed with the program in binary form. FFmpeg is itself licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later (read more here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html).

A big thanks to FFmpeg for creating and sharing their tool.

The Multi-region Exporter is also distributed with its 'own' copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This is because the Exporter runs on Java - the JRE is included to ensure that the Exporter has access to a compatible JRE version. While this does make the application around 9 times as big as if relying on a public JRE on the user's computer, I think it is worth the extra megabytes. The included JRE is from OpenJDK and it has its own licence agreement, which can be found here: https://openjdk.java.net/legal/

It must also be mentioned that Cubase and Steinberg have nothing to do with the development of this tool and therefore they are in no way responsible for it - its functionality / lack of functionality or for supporting it.
