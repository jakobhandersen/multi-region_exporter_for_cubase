Here is the source code for the Multi-region Exporter – for Cubase version 2.0

It is written in Java and it uses the SWT toolkit for the GUI. 
The actual audio splitting is done by the command line application SoX – Sound eXchange (http://sox.sourceforge.net), which is included here in binary form.
The generation of audio waveform and the optional conversion to other formats is done by FFmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) which is distributed with the program in binary form.

Since the Multi-region Exporter is developed in Eclipse, the source code is structured as Eclipse workspaces – one for Mac and one for Windows. Opening one of the two workspaces ("*workspace" folders) in Eclipse should work.

The actual source code is shared between the Mac and PC workspaces as a linked folder ("Standalone-src"). The same goes for the folder "Standalone-assets". 
I had all the folders in a Dropbox folder in order to sync between the two platforms.  The reason I worked with two separate workspaces is that the SWT library (and other resources) are different on the two platforms. It might not be the most elegant solution, but it worked for me.

Ideas for improvements / further developments:
-Create support for command line use of the program, suggested by Cubase forum user vitraska
-Check multi-threading consistency (thread safety, synchronization etc.). I haven’t really worked with multi-threading before, so there might be some issues to fix here
-Support for Logic as well as Cubase? (Does Logic have a similar track export feature or is multi-region exporting natively supported in Logic?)
-More testing of splitting accuracy and sample value conservation. So far, tests have given only good results but more testing could be done
-Clean up code in XML parser (currently quite a lot of code duplication)
