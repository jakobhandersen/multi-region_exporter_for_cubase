On Mac:
- export runnable jar
- make into .app by using Pyxis Jar Bundler (remember to use private JRE)
- make changes in info.plist file (in show package content):
	- delete item "-splash:[someFile]" in JVMOptions (since splash screen doesn't seem to work properly)
	- add item "-XstartOnFirstThread" to JVMOptions (necessary argument for SWT on Mac)
	- change the value of key CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations to false (otherwise menu items are grayed out on non-english systems)
- replace the "jre" folder in "Plugins" (copied by the Pyxis application) with a manual copy of the JRE  (since all executables are not executable when copied by the Jar Bundler)
- copy folders "sox" and "ffmpeg" into the "Contents" folder
	- "sox" should contain sox and soxi (for mac)
	- "ffmpeg" should contain ffmpeg (for mac)


On Windows
- export runnable jar
- make into .exe by using Launch4j (remember to use private JRE)
- copy folder "documentation" into same folder as .exe
	- "documentation" should contain "documentation.pdf"
- copy "resources" folder into same folder as .exe
	- "resources" should contain folders "sox" and a jre folder specified in Launch4j
		- "sox" should contain sox and soxi (for windows)
		- "ffmpeg should contain ffmpeg (for windows)
		- the jre folder should contain the private JRE (can be copied from "Java" folder in "program files")
